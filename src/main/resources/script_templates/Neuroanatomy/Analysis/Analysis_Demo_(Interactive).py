info:       Exemplifies how to programmatically interact with a running instance
            of SNT to analyze traced data. Because of all the GUI updates, this
            approach is _significantly slower_ than analyzing reconstructions
            directly (see Analysis_Demo.py for comparison)

    # The SNTService contains convenience methods that will simplify

    # directly, but we'll use SNTService whenever pertinent.

    # Let's start SNT's GUI if it is currently not running
    if not snt.getUI():
        snt.initialize(True)  # display GUI?

    # to retrieve the demo image associated with this data

    # Almost all SNT analyses are performed on a Tree, i.e., a collection of
    # Paths. To do so we can use TreeAnalyzer or TreeStatistics (the latter
    # features all of TreeAnalyzer's capabilities plus advanced functionality
    # for detailed statistics. We can instantiate both from SNTService using
    # 1) all the Paths currently loaded, or 2) just the current subset of
    # selected Paths in the Path Manager dialog.
    # This is useful when one only wants to analyze the group(s) of Paths
    # selected through Path Manager's filtering toolbar.

    # useful for post-hoc analysis and if, e.g, one needs to manipulate Paths
    # in advance.

    summary_stats = stats.getSummaryStats(metric)
    stats.getHistogram(metric).show()
    print("Smallest inter-node distance: %d" % summary_stats.getMin())

    # E.g., let's' downsample the Tree, imposing 10um between 'shaft' nodes:
    # When downsampling, branch points and tip positions are not altered
    tree = snt.getTree(False) # Retrieve only paths selected in the Manager?
    tree.downSample(10) # 10um
    tree.setLabel("10um downsampled")
